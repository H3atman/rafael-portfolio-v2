## Project Overview

Content marketing is essential for businesses, but creating and publishing SEO-optimized blog posts consistently is time-consuming. I built an automated content pipeline using n8n that handles everything from content generation to WordPress publishing with featured images—turning what used to be a 1-2 hour manual process into a one-minute automated workflow.

<Callout type="info">
  **Impact**: This automation has generated and published **100+ blog posts** across multiple clients since November 2025, with each post taking approximately 1 minute from trigger to live publication.
</Callout>

## The Challenge

Creating blog content for clients involves multiple tedious steps:
- Writing SEO-optimized content with proper keyword density
- Creating meta descriptions and URL slugs
- Downloading and uploading featured images
- Formatting content with internal links
- Publishing to WordPress with correct settings
- Creating follow-up tasks for content review
- Updating content calendars and tracking sheets

**The manual process was inefficient:**
- Even with AI assistance (ChatGPT, Claude), writers spend 1-2 hours per post going back and forth for proper context
- Featured image handling requires multiple browser tabs and uploads
- Internal linking is often inconsistent or forgotten
- Task creation and sheet updates are easily missed

## Solution: End-to-End Content Automation

### Architecture

  caption="Complete n8n workflow showing the content generation and publishing pipeline" 
/>

**The workflow operates in five stages:**

1. **Content Scheduling** - Schedule trigger pulls topics from a Google Sheet content calendar, checking if today matches the scheduled publish date

2. **Article Generation** - OpenAI generates SEO-optimized HTML content using a comprehensive system prompt with internal linking rules, keyphrase density targets, and brand guidelines baked in

3. **Content Processing** - Additional AI calls generate meta descriptions and URL-friendly slugs automatically

4. **Image Handling** - Extracts featured images from Google Drive, converts share links to direct download URLs, and uploads to WordPress media library

5. **Publishing & Task Management** - Posts to WordPress with proper author, status, and featured image, then creates ClickUp tasks for content review and updates the tracking sheet

## Key Features

- **Pre-configured Context** - System prompts contain complete brand guidelines, internal linking URLs, and SEO requirements—no back-and-forth needed
- **Scheduled Publishing** - Content calendar in Google Sheets controls when articles go live
- **Automatic Internal Linking** - AI inserts relevant service links based on predefined URL mappings
- **Featured Image Pipeline** - Handles Google Drive → WordPress media upload automatically
- **Task Generation** - Creates ClickUp tasks with article links, image references, and review instructions
- **Progress Tracking** - Updates Google Sheets with published article URLs for client visibility

## Workflow Components

The automation chains together multiple specialized nodes:

- **Schedule Trigger** - Runs daily at 6 AM to check for scheduled content
- **Google Sheets** - Reads content calendar and updates with published URLs
- **IF Node** - Validates publish date matches current date
- **OpenAI Agent Node** - Generates article content with extensive system prompting
- **Code Node** - Processes Google Drive links and calculates task due dates
- **HTTP Request Node** - Handles WordPress media uploads and post updates
- **ClickUp** - Creates review tasks assigned to the content team
- **Slack** - Notifies team of new articles (optional)

**Beyond time savings:**
- **100+ posts published** across multiple clients since launch
- **Consistent SEO optimization** with proper keyphrase density
- **Zero missed internal links** thanks to predefined URL mappings
- **Complete audit trail** through Google Sheets logging
- **Reduced cognitive load** - clients only need to provide topics and images

## Technologies Used

- **n8n** - Workflow automation platform (self-hosted)
- **OpenAI GPT-4** - Content generation with custom system prompts
- **LangChain** - Agent framework for structured AI outputs
- **WordPress REST API** - Publishing and media management
- **Google Sheets** - Content calendar and tracking
- **Google Drive** - Featured image storage
- **ClickUp** - Task management integration
- **Slack** - Team notifications (optional)

## Lessons Learned

1. **Context is everything** - The difference between mediocre and great AI output is the system prompt. Investing time in comprehensive prompts with specific URLs, brand voice, and formatting rules eliminates the back-and-forth that makes manual AI-assisted writing slow.

2. **Google Drive links need conversion** - Share links from Google Drive don't work for direct downloads. The workflow includes a Code node that extracts file IDs and constructs proper download URLs.

3. **WordPress media before posts** - Featured images must be uploaded to the media library first, then attached to posts via a separate API call. The workflow handles this two-step process automatically.

4. **Date comparison quirks** - Comparing dates across systems (Google Sheets, n8n, WordPress) requires careful formatting. The workflow normalizes dates to avoid timezone and format mismatches.

5. **Build review into the process** - Automated doesn't mean unsupervised. The ClickUp task creation ensures every generated article gets human review before the client sees it, maintaining quality while saving time.
