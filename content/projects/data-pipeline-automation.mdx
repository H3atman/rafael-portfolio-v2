## Project Overview

As a Crime Statistician for a government agency, I was tasked with modernizing the data processing infrastructure used to analyze crime statistics across multiple jurisdictions. The existing system was outdated, slow, and couldn't handle the growing volume of data.

## The Challenge

- **Legacy systems**: Data was stored in outdated formats with inconsistent structures
- **Volume growth**: Data volume had increased 10x over 5 years
- **Processing delays**: Monthly reports took 2+ weeks to generate
- **Quality issues**: Missing data and inconsistencies affected report accuracy
- **Limited analysis**: Existing tools couldn't perform advanced statistical analysis

## Solution Implemented

I designed and built a modern data processing pipeline:

1. **Data ingestion** - Automated collection from multiple source systems
2. **Quality assurance** - Implemented data validation and cleaning rules
3. **Transformation** - Standardized data formats and calculated derived metrics
4. **Analysis engine** - Built statistical analysis modules for trend detection
5. **Visualization** - Created interactive dashboards for stakeholders

### Pipeline Architecture

```
Source Systems → Data Lake → ETL Processing → Data Warehouse → Analytics → Reports
```

## Key Features

- **Automated data quality checks** with error flagging and alerts
- **Historical data reconciliation** for trend analysis
- **Geographic mapping** of crime statistics by jurisdiction
- **Predictive modeling** for resource allocation
- **Compliance reporting** meeting government standards

## Results

- **90% faster** report generation (2 weeks → 2 days)
- **99.8% data accuracy** after validation implementation
- **Real-time dashboards** for executive decision-making
- **Advanced analytics** enabling predictive policing initiatives
- **Scalable infrastructure** handling 10x data growth

## Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy)
- SQL Server / PostgreSQL
- Power BI / Tableau
- Azure Data Factory
- Statistical modeling (R)
