## Project Overview

A startup company was spending over 20 hours per week manually compiling reports from multiple data sources. The leadership team needed real-time visibility into operations but was constrained by outdated spreadsheet-based processes.

## The Challenge

- **Multiple data sources**: Sales, inventory, and financial data were scattered across 5+ platforms
- **Manual consolidation**: Team members spent hours copy-pasting data into Excel
- **Delayed insights**: Reports were often 3-5 days behind, making them less actionable
- **Error-prone**: Manual data entry led to frequent errors and inconsistencies

## Solution Implemented

I designed and implemented an automated reporting pipeline that:

1. **Unified data collection** - Connected APIs from Shopify, QuickBooks, and internal databases
2. **Automated ETL processes** - Built data transformation pipelines using Python and Make.com
3. **Real-time dashboards** - Created interactive Power BI dashboards with auto-refresh
4. **Scheduled reports** - Automated daily/weekly email reports to stakeholders

## Results

> "This system transformed how we make decisions. We went from looking at last week's data to having real-time insights at our fingertips."

- **80% reduction** in manual data entry time
- **99.5% accuracy** in automated reports vs ~92% with manual entry
- **Real-time visibility** - Reports now available instantly instead of days later
- **20+ hours saved** per week across the team

## Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, APIs)
- Make.com (Integromat)
- Power BI
- PostgreSQL
- REST APIs
