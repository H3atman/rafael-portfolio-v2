## Project Overview

A growing company had adopted a new CRM system but struggled with connecting it to their existing tech stack. Customer data was fragmented across platforms, leading to poor customer experiences and missed opportunities.

## The Challenge

- **Data silos**: Customer information existed in separate systems with no synchronization
- **Manual updates**: Sales team had to update customer info in 3+ systems separately
- **Lost context**: Support teams couldn't see customer purchase history or previous interactions
- **Integration complexity**: Multiple legacy systems with different data formats and APIs

## Solution Implemented

I architected a comprehensive integration solution:

1. **API Gateway** - Created a central integration hub connecting all systems
2. **Real-time sync** - Implemented bi-directional data synchronization between CRM and other platforms
3. **Data mapping** - Standardized customer data formats across all systems
4. **Workflow automation** - Triggered automated actions based on customer events

### Systems Integrated

| System | Integration Type | Data Flow |
|--------|-----------------|-----------|
| CRM (HubSpot) | REST API | Bi-directional |
| E-commerce (Shopify) | Webhooks | Real-time |
| Accounting (QuickBooks) | OAuth API | Scheduled sync |
| Support (Zendesk) | API | Real-time |
| Marketing (Mailchimp) | API | Event-triggered |

## Results

- **100% data consistency** across all platforms
- **Zero manual entry** for customer updates
- **360° customer view** available to all teams
- **30% faster** customer issue resolution
- **15% increase** in sales conversion (better context)

## Technologies Used

- Make.com / Zapier
- REST APIs & Webhooks
- Node.js (custom middleware)
- PostgreSQL (staging database)
- OAuth 2.0 authentication
